# Sergeant Shame

We are "Sergeant Shame." I'm Rodolphe, I worked with Nicolas and Vida. So, this project had two inspirations.

The drill sergeant from full metal jacket.

And my inability to go to the gym. And the problem is that behavior change is hard. Whether you're trying to hit the gym or practice your skills.

One problem is accountability, it's hard if you're just accountable to yourself. So we though,

Why not get your friends and a heap of public shame to help you out?

So the way this works is, you give us access to your facebook.

Tell us what you want to do, for example practice skills 1000 times per day at TC Disrupt.

Now go about your business, checking in when you do what you need to.

But if you forget...

We call you a useless sack of shit in front of all your friends.
